3. **Logging:**  
   - Incident details recorded in DynamoDB audit log (see [audit_log_schema.json](../config/audit_log_schema.json)).
   - Complete incident entry created using the template above.

4. **Investigation:**  
   - DevOps/Security team investigates root cause and impact.

5. **Resolution:**  
   - Remediation steps performed.
   - Alert status updated to "Resolved" in the monitoring system.
   - Resolution details logged.

6. **Review:**
